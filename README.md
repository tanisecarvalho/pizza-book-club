## Bugs
1. Homepage keeps with an extra margin on the right side.

    I had a margin of 2rem on the about-us section that was causing the issue. I commented section by section to see which one was causing the issue. I added a 0 on the margin for the sides.
2. Footer was not sticking to the bottom.
    I put bottom: 0, but it still was not working. Devtools showed that it would not be changed with a static position. So I changed the footer position to absolute and width to 100% because it change the width to smaller when I changed the position.
    Changing to absolute worked with pages with less content but not with larger content, so I changed to fixed and it worked.
    Fixed did not work with larger contents. I changed the body to min-height: 100vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; and added flex-grow: 1 to the join-us section which was the only one that the content did not reach the end for the footer to stay in the bottom as suggested here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34796085/how-to-stick-footer-to-bottom-not-fixed-even-with-scrolling
